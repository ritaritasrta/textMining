HEY this is Rita 🗣 and welcome to my text mining project. This txt file will be used as an input feeder. I'm just going to type a bunch of stuff here and feed it into the main program that is called text_summarizer. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos and tried to copy different methods and pieced together different variations on how to efficiently write a summarizer program. Feel free to scour the code and download it to run your text file through. It can really help you with summarizing textbooks, books, phamphlets, etc. Enjoy!
